For the STged toy example setup:
### File Structure and Contents:
1. **Code File Folder**:
   - **Benchmark File**: Contains the code for benchmark methods used in comparisons.
   - **Module File**: Holds the code for proposed module analyses specifically designed for STged applications on real data.
   - **Figures Code**: Includes scripts for generating figures as part of the analysis.

2. **Simulation Folder**:
   - Contains both the **code** and **demo files** required to reproduce the main and supplementary results in the STged simulation study.

3. **Demo File Folder**:
   - Contains **code** and **demo files** for reproducing main and supplementary results from real data analyses in the STged study.

This structure should allow straightforward access to necessary code and demos for both simulated and real data, facilitating reproducibility of STged analyses.
