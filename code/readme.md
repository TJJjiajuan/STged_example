Here, we provide the evaluation code and figure generation scripts used in our manuscript. Additionally, we include the proposed module code for reproducibility and further exploration.

**Please note:**
if you encounter any issues or prefer not to install the STged package via `devtools::install_github("TJJjiajuan/STged")`, feel free to contact me, or you can simply source the `stged.R` code file directly to run the analysis.
