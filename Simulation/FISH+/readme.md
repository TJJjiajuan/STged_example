The folder contains three Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) files, each dedicated to running gene expression deconvolution methods under different conditions:

1. **Gene Expression Estimation**: This notebook estimates gene expression levels for each cell type within each spatial spot, using both true and estimated cell type proportions.

2. **Robustness Evaluation**: This file evaluates the robustness of STged with respect to the accuracy of estimated cell type proportions.

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: This notebook assesses the sensitivity of STged to variations in tuning parameters. 

These files support a comprehensive analysis of STged and related methods, enhancing the reproducibility of our manuscriptâ€™s findings.
