The folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file with three sections, each dedicated to running gene expression deconvolution methods under different conditions:

1. **Gene Expression Estimation**: Estimates gene expression levels for each cell type within each spatial spot, using both true and estimated cell type proportions.

2. **Robustness Evaluation**: Evaluates the robustness of STged with respect to the accuracy of estimated cell type proportions.

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Assesses the sensitivity of STged to variations in tuning parameters.

These notebooks facilitate a comprehensive analysis of STged and related methods, supporting the reproducibility of our manuscriptâ€™s findings.
