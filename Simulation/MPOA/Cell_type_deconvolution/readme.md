# Benchmarking Methods for Cell Type Deconvolution

This repository includes the benchmarking methods for cell type deconvolution. We provide the complete gene expression data for both the simulated Spatial Transcriptomics (SRT) dataset and the reference scRNA-seq dataset.

For each simulated dataset, we apply the cell type deconvolution code and include the corresponding results in each folder.

## Deconvolution Methods for EnDecon

In this study, we employ six cell type deconvolution methods, including CARD, RCTD, SpatialDWLS, SPOTlight, Stereoscope, and cell2location. EnDecon ensembles the results from these six methods to improve accuracy.

Additionally, we apply code and provide results from two other cell type deconvolution methods, such as SONAR and RCTD.
